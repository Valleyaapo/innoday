Some stuff has been preset in the db for the software to run smoothly

#1 Voter type has been preset as below. If the voter is visitor, teacher, student they do not need to
select the team in the software - this might need some tweaking in further development.
innomem represents the teams - if a voter has a team as they are added as voters their type is INNOMEM 
which represents that they do have a team they do belong which they must choose as they login to the voting system
	STUDENT
	TEACHER
	VISITOR
	INNOMEM
	
#2 Always have a team with team_id '1' - not_in_team (included in CREATES file)
	This id and the name represent the students, teachers and visitors in the voting
	This might need some tweaking in further development, so far this has been the most convenient solution.
	
#3 Please, note that the team_id 1 /is/ included in the test data inserts, you cannot add it multiple times.

#4 Feel free to create more test data in case you do not have the data required
