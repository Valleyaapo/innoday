# Further development ideas for the software
Three votes for a voter, names are not probably necessary info in the database for usage
but how to ensure a voter does not vote more than three times if there's no name check?
The % of the given votes among the voters next to the amount of the votes

# Further usage of the software
Admin should check the status of the software in a good time before the need of the usage
Maybe a week or two before the event, in which the engine is required, collect the data from
the innovators at their class to make sure that every innovation is added?
